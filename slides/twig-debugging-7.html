  This is very useful for finding which template is being used to print your component, if the template is in the classy theme for example, you know exactly which template to copy into your theme for your overrides. By naming the file something more specific you can ensure that the override only happens when you want, or by leaving the name the same you will use your template any time this generic component is printed- such as every block.
