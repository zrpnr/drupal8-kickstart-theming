<h2>Filter Arrays</h2>

<pre><code class="twig">
  {# Working with render arrays #}
  
  {# Print all the page content except for the title and tabs. #}
  {{ page.content|without('pagetitle','tabs') }}
  
  {# FINE! Print the page title. #}
  {{ page.content.pagetitle) }}

  {# Working with plain ol' arrays #}
  {% set numbers = [1, 2, 3] %}}

  {{ numbers|join }}            {# '123' #}  
  {{ numbers|join('|') }}       {# '1|2|3' #}

</code></pre>

  Twig also lets you loop over arrays, join them and print out as strings or print specific items.
  Without is very useful and is similar to how you could "hide" a render array element in D7. If you for example wanted to print a field directly in your template, you can then print the rest of the page content without that single field.
