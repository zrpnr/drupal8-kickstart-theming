<h1>New Stuff</h1>
<p>Changes from Drupal 7 to 8</p>
<aside class="notes">
  A lot has changed in D8, but the theme layer especially has undergone a major overhaul.
  Its now using a better templating engine, follows modern css structural guidelines and core themes are mobile responsive.
  If you were just in this room for Daniel's excellent overview of D8, he covered some of these changes but hopeflly this will be a deeper dive into just the changes from a theme side.
