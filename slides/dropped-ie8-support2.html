Drupal 8 uses SVG for icons in the admin UI, there's no fallback for browsers that don't support svg, like ie8 and below, or older android browsers.

jQuery stopped supporting ie8 with version 2.0, 
I also wanted to mention here that jquery versions get incremented with the minor releases of Drupal core- this is exactly what was promised with D8 development, that core itself would change over time and not be frozen to the year it was first releasd.

D7 I believe was stuck with jquery 1.4.4, and to use anything more recent required using modules like jquery update.
It's really great to see that drupal core is now able to keep up with the rest of software development and advance more than every 5 years!
