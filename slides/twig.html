  Twig is the templating language used in Symfony, but was chosen for drupal because of its useful features and clean syntax.
  It's also another example of "Not invented here" which is a common concept in D8 architecture, leveraging the advances in the wider php community to improve Drupal. The added benefit is non drupal php developers will see more familiar architecture and more easily join the Drupal community.
  Could I just see a quick show of hands of how many of you have used twig in your own projects?
