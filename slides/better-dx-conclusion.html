  There are big changes in Drupal from 7 to 8, but most of them should feel familiar if you're already a drupal developer.
  The folder structure is the same- just organized more intuitively. Now you put your themes in the themes folder just like anyone looking at D7 for the first time would have expected.
  YML is used across core because it's a simple, readable and useful language for writing declarative config. No more unique one off file types like .info.
  Twig is the biggest change, and it bring drupal theming up to date with other libraries such as symfony, and should look familiar to any developer who has used blade in laravel, or even javascript templating languages lke mustache or handlebars. Twig brings a huge number of security improvements, convenience, and means theming is greatly simplified since everything is now in an actual template file instead of possilby being printed with a complex theme function.
  Libraries was a part of D7 as a contrib module, but by bringing it into core it is much more useful and easier to bundle assets and include them where necessary.
