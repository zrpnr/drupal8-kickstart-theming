  Twig makes the Drupal theme layer faster and more secure. It's impossible to run PHP scripts, make database calls or access the file system.

  It's not likely a dev would ever write something lke this- but they *could* and it is very common to see a lot of php code written directly in templates, as there's nothing to prevent a developer from putting their logic wherever they wanted.

  All of the PHPTemplate files (*.tpl.php) were converted to Twig template files (*.html.twig).
