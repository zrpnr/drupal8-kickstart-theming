<h2>Dot notation</h2>

<pre><code class="twig">
  {# Print the value of the field without the field markup #}

  {{ node.field_name.value }}

</code></pre>

<div class="fragment">
  <h4>Escaped by default</h4>
  <pre><code class="twig">
    {# Do it again, but like you don't care #}
  
    {{ node.field_name.value|raw }}
  
  </code></pre>
</div>
<aside class="notes">
  A dot can be used to access the attributes of a variable, or print a nested value. The dot syntax in twig works for  nested array values,   as well as object properties and methods.

  Notice the pipe there in that last example- that's using a feature of twig called "filtering".
