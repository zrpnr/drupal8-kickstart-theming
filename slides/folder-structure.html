  Drupal has traditionally had a folder structure which is confusing to new developers, there was an obvious "themes" folder that seemed like a good place to place your custom themes- but it was part of core. You had to put everything in sites/all/themes, 
  D8 now keeps all the core files in a "core" folder- meaning that when it's time to update core itself the process is much tidier, and it's less tempting to mix your custom code into core. 
  Outside the core directory are modules and themes folders. It's a good practice to add a couple additional folders, contrib and custom
