  Twig has built in debugging features, you can dump the entire context of a page, or use the _context global to print just one part of the page, such as the keys. You want to be careful about a WSOD as this is a recursive operation and your system may run out of memory trying to print every variable and all its children and their children.
  To dump a single variable, just pass it as an argument.
