<h2>Attaching Libraries</h2>
<p><code>[#attached] on a Render Array</code></p>
<pre><code class="php">
  $build['an_element']['#attached']['library'][] = 'mytheme/chosen';

</code></pre>
<aside class="notes">
  It's encouraged to attach libraries just where you need them, so if you're only using that code on a single page just attach it with a render array, or in the template directly if you have an override.
