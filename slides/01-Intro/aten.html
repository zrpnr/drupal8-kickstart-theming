<aside class="notes">Aten is a Strategy, Design and Development agency based in Denver, CO. Denver has a very healthy drupal community, we hosted DrupalCon in 2012, not sure if anyone here attended. Denver is home to some other notable agencies besides aten, and coming up this august we have our annual drupalcamp with lots of great sessions trainings and speakers. Come find me at the Aten table upstairs if you have any interest in attending that or if you have any questions for me after this talk.</aside>
