  .info files have been converted to YAML and the old .info parser has been removed
  yaml is used all over drupal now, if you're familiar with the new CMI system you'll know that Drupal config is also exported as yml.
  YAML is a human friendly data serialization standard and is used in the symfony project, which was a main motivator for pulling using it everywhere in D8.
