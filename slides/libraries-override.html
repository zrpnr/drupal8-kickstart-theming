<aside class="notes">
  you may wish to replace a core library, or one that's attached by a base theme. Just by adding a blank library of the same name as a property of the existing library you can remove it entirely.
  You can also replace a single asset the same way- specify which individual file you want to replace, or set it to false to ust remove it.
